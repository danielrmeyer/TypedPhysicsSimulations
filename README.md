# TypedPhysicsSimulations
This is an experiment in using Scala for physics simulations

# Set-up

You will need to get the Open Source Physics Framework build and add the jar to the project locally.
With sbt, create a lib directory and add the jar there.  To build the jar you currently need to use
the Eclipse IDE to build and export a jar file from the OSP source code:
https://github.com/OpenSourcePhysics

I plan to create a better solution to this if the experiment works out.  Feel free to reach out
for help if you are interested in running my code.


# Project Goals

See if scala 3 can create a compelling environment for physics simulation work.
